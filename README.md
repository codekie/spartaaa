`Spartaaa` is a Web-frontend for taskwarrior.

**CAUTION: USE AT OWN RISK!** If you use this app, make sure that you made a backup of the Taskwarrior-data, first.


# Requirements

- `Taskwarrior` pre-installed
- NodeJS `8`
- macOS

If the app is not run on a `macOS`, the path to the Taskwarrior-data, has to be set as env-variable
(`SPARTAAA_PATH_TASKWARRIOR_DATA`).


# How to run the app

The dependencies, for the server, have to be installed first. To do this, run

```
yarn install
```

To start the server, execute

```
yarn start
```

The web-app will be accessible at http://localhost:3010


# How does it work

While the web-app itself, is served from an express-webserver, the communication between frontend and backend happens
via Websockets.

This app does not access the Taskwarrior-data directly. The access happens through the Taskwarrior-CLI.

There is a watch on the directory, which contains the Taskwarrior-data (preconfigured for `macOS`, which is `~/.task`)
and as soon as any file within that directory is modified, the tasks will be exported and pushed to the client.


# Development

## How to start the tests

```
yarn test
```


## Start the server in dev mode

```
yarn run start-dev
```

This will start the express- and websocket-server, additionally to a Webpack-dev-server. There are file-watches on
the server-components, which will restart the server automatically, as well as file-watches on the frontend-code, which
will recompile the frontend and hot-reload it in the browser.

The Webpack-dev-server, which will serve the hot-reloadable frontend, will be accessible at http://localhost:8080


## Motivation

The initial motivation, was to create a React-boilerplate for future projects. Taskwarrior was just a proof of concept
to build upon. However, it turned to out to become useful and so the development went on.
